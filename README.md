Text Adventure For Game Technology Class C220

I'm sorry to have bugged you so much about items and then not implement them but I did not have enough time to incorporate them with this already being a day late. I had more then I thought due these past two days and trying to fit in a few hours of sleep proved to be a challenge as well. As such I promise to not let myself wait this much on a porject in the future. 

Some Directions:
Going off cardinal directions they will be way your way to navigate everywhere. Sometimes right and left are symbolized through EAST and WEST, and Up and Down paaths are symbolized by NORTH and SOUTH, but those four commands are all that's needed until a player gets to an ending.  

Slight Intro:
You play the role of a Federation lackey who has crash landed on a barren planet (as in no sentient life) on the edge of the galaxy after getting caught in a fight between you and your mortal enemy: the Rebels. No real combat experience, no real survival experince. Seemingly only surviving through your keen eyes and wit. Or rather, maybe not.

I seem to have forgotten to have sent my push to the master on GitHub. It should now correctly have pushed the commit through the desktop. This came in late as I thought it had turned in before sending it in on canvas. I only noticed just before I closed GitHub. I hope you can forgive this mistake.
